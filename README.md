# SeleniumDriverUpdater
This is a library i've been working on latetly.For those developers that work with selenium, one of the most common issue that appears using Selenium drivers is to update the version of the drivers . That can be pretty often . 
This is a really annoying fact that makes developers think of a solution . This libray project does the job for you. When an error occurs while trying to create instance of the driver, the job that is responsible to do is to 
check the installed version of the Chrome/Edge driver of the computer and download the version that this driver , unzip it and replace it with the old one.
